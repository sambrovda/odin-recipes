            <li>1 tbsp (8 g) chili powder</li>
            <li>2 tsp (6 g) salt</li>

            <li>½ medium (100 g) onion</li>
            <li>½ cup (56 g) cheddar cheese shredded</li>
            <li>2 tbsp (30 g) olive oil</li>

    <h4>Recipe Instructions</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Cook enough rice to yield 3 cups of cooked rice. 1 cup of dry rice will make around 2-3 cups of cooked rice depending on what kind you use.</li>
                <li>In a large bowl add the chicken, a bit of oil, chili powder, salt, and pepper. Toss to coat.</li>
                <li>You can cook your chicken however you like. I baked mine at 425°F for 10 minutes and then broiled it on the top rack for 5 minutes to develop color. Cut into 1 inch pieces. If you would rather pan fry it follow the instructions in the next step.</li>
                <li>Heat a grill pan or a skillet over medium high heat and add some oil. Cook the chicken thighs for 4-5 minutes on each side. Cut them into a large dice and return to the pan to develop color.</li>
                <li>Wash and cut your zucchini into a small dice and mushrooms into a large dice. Cut the onion into a small dice.</li>
                <li>Heat a large skillet over medium high heat. Add oil and saute the onions for a couple of minutes.</li>
                <li>Add a bit more oil and add in the mushrooms, season with salt to help bring out the water. Allow them to cook and develop color.</li>
                <li>Add in the zuchinni and cook until soft.</li>
                <li>Measure out 3 cups of cooked rice and add to a large bowl. Mix in the chicken, vegetables, cheese, and buffalo sauce. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
            </ol>
